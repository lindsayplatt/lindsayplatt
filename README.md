### Greetings ðŸ––

I'm Lindsay (she/her) and I currently wear two hats:

ðŸ‘’ I am an Environmental Data Scientist at [CUAHSI](www.cuahsi.org) 

ðŸŽ“ I am also a graduate student in the [Dugan Lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://dugan.limnology.wisc.edu/)

<br></br>
I love all things reproducibility and open science. I was previously a Water Data Scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey (see the group's cool stuff on Twitter [@USGS_DataSci](https://twitter.com/USGS_DataSci)). Ask me about using [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) to organize scientific workflows or show me your messy data and I'm hooked ðŸŽ£
